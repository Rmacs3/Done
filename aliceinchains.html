    <h1>Alice In Chains</h1>
    <p>Alice In Chains is an American rock band from Seattle, Washington, formed in 1987 by guitarist and <br>vocalist Jerry Cantrell and drummer Sean Kinney, who later recruited bassist Mike Starr and lead vocalist Layne Staley. Starr was replaced <br>by Mike Inez in 1993. William DuVall joined the band in 2006 as co-lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, replacing Staley, who had died in <br> 2002 from drug overdose. The band took its name from Staley's previous group, the glam metal band Alice N' Chains. This was my first <br>time listening to grunge music and i never looked back. Grunge music quickly became one of my favorite genres during my highschool years. I think layne Stayley has <br>the best voice in rock music because he could wail like no other. The guitar riffs and bass riffs hit like no other. Some of my favorite songs are... </p>
