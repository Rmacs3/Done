    <h1>Twenty One Pilots</h1>
    <p>Twenty One Pilots are an American musical duo from Columbus, Ohio. Initially a band, the group was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist <br>Tyler Joseph along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer Josh Dun. The duo is best known for their <br>singles "Stressed Out", "Ride", and "Heathens". I was obsessed with twenty pilots all through middle school and highschool. Their fans call them schizophrenic pop<br> and i couldnt think of a better way to describe them. They have a sound that is constantly changing. They do also have <br>a lot of angsty songs thatv arent my favortes but there is way more good than there is bad. I think Blurryface is one of the greatest <br>albums i have ever heard. I still listen to them today because i think their music is so refshing. Some of my favorite songs are... </p>

     <li>Ride</li>
    <li>Chlorine</li>
    <li>Stressed Out</li>
    <li>Doubt</li>
    <li>Nico And The Niners</li>
