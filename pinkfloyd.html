    <h1>Pink Floyd</h1>
    <p>Pink Floyd are an English rock band formed in London in 1965. Gaining an early <br>following as one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished by their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics <br> and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band of the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time. <br>Pink Floyd were founded in 1965 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger Waters (bass guitar, vocals) and Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals). Pink Floyd is my go to for <br>chill and relaxing music. This is great slow music for latenight car rides or chilling with friends. I found out about <br> Pink floyd early in my lif but i never really listned to them until college. Some of my favorite songs are... </p>
